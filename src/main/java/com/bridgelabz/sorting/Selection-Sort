Problem Statement:
An e-commerce company wants to display product prices in ascending order. Implement
Quick Sort to sort the product prices.

Hint:
● Pick a pivot element (first, last, or random).
● Partition the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger
ones are on the right.
● Recursively apply Quick Sort on left and right partitions.
